## Original repo
https://github.com/vervallsweg/cast-web-api
You can follow the installation guide here.

## Disclaimer
We are not the original creators of this repo and dont intent to sell the code. We just needed a selfcontrolled Repo for our project.

# implementation in Project heartbeat
https://github.com/bryanvolckaertschool/Projectheartbeats

We use cast-web-api to connect to our google-cast capable devices. 
The functions we use are the following:
    - play
    - pause
    - status (see volume status, playback status etc.)
    - device (see devices on your network)

# what's different from the original repo?
To prevent problems in using 2 seperate servers for the cast-web-api and the selfmade Node-js server we had to allow it in the cors authentication.
